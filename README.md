BOSI
====

The name BOSI stands for "BreakOut, Scala In". It is a [Breakout clone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_clone), as well as my first attempt at writing a Scala application.

Uses JavaFX 8 for graphics, and JInput for receving input from the player via keyboard or gamepad.

This project depends on the [Game Engine](https://github.com/TinusTinus/game-engine) project.
